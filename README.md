Problem Statement: Portfolio Analysis and Risk-Return Trade-off for Commodities, Stocks, and Cryptocurrencies (Special thanks to Nikhil)

Objective:
This project aims to analyze and compare the risk-return profiles of portfolios consisting of commodities, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. The goal is to assess which asset class offers the best balance of returns and risk, helping investors make informed decisions based on their risk tolerance and investment goals.

Key Goals:

Portfolio Performance Analysis:

Calculate expected daily returns and volatility for each asset class: commodities, stocks, and cryptocurrencies.
Compare the performance of the three asset classes to identify the highest return and the associated risks.
Risk-Return Trade-off:

Analyze the risk and return trade-offs for each portfolio to determine the best investment strategy based on different investor profiles (high-risk vs. low-risk).
Data Visualization:

Use data visualization techniques (e.g., graphs, charts) to display key insights and make complex data easily interpretable for better decision-making.
Actionable Insights:

Provide actionable insights for investors, highlighting which portfolio would best suit their investment goals and risk appetite.
Deliverables:

A detailed report summarizing findings on expected returns and volatility for each asset class.
Visualizations of portfolio performance and risk-return trade-offs.
A recommendation on the optimal portfolio based on risk and return analysis.
